# Socket Plugs

## Overview

This project features a collection of applications built using Socket's data layer.

### Important Directories

- `contracts` - Source code for the contracts.
- `deployments` - Deployment addresses for the project, categorized by project type (SuperToken, SuperBridge).
- `scripts` - Scripts for deploying, verifying contracts, and more.
- `scripts/constants/projectConstants` - Project constants, categorized by project type (SuperToken, SuperBridge).
- `src/enums` - Token and project enums.
- `test` - Tests for the contracts.

### Components

**SuperToken**
SuperTokens are contracts that enable the creation of tokens on multiple chains. They function by locking/unlocking tokens on the initial chain using a Vault and minting/burning tokens on the destination chain using a Controller. More details on SuperTokens can be found [here](./SUPERTOKEN_README.md).

**SuperBridge**
SuperBridges are contracts that allow Chains or AppChains to onboard assets and tokens from other chains. They use lock/unlock mechanisms on the source chain and mint/burn mechanisms on the destination chain. More details on SuperBridges can be found [here](./SUPERBRIDGE_README.md).

**Hook Contracts**
Hooks are extensions to the SuperBridge and SuperToken. They add additional functionality to the bridge or token and are invoked during the execution of a SuperBridge or SuperToken transaction.

## Setup

Clone project and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socket-plugs
```

Move to the repository folder and install dependencies.

```bash
cd socket-plugs
```

Install all dependencies.

```bash
yarn setup:all
```

## Create a new project

To create a new project, run:

```bash
yarn project:new
```

Follow the prompts to create a new project. This will create a new project in `scripts/constants/projectConstants/supertoken/projectname_<mainnet/testnet>.ts` or `scripts/constants/projectConstants/superbridge/projectname_<mainnet/testnet>.ts`.

**Note:** SuperBridge allows custom setups where multiple tokens on the vault chain can be mapped to a single token on the app chain. For more information, refer to the **Project Constants Help Guide** section and contact the team for assistance.

**Note:** this scripts updates your .env to add relevant env variables. If you have anything sensitive/important in .env file, please take a backup first.

## SuperBridge requirements

- On the destination chain, the token must be deployed and follow the [IMintableERC20 interface](./contracts/interfaces/IMintableERC20.sol).
  - If you want to deploy (and verify) a test token on destination chain to get started with testing, can use the following command (Note : don't use this in production) -
  ```bash
  forge create --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> \
    --constructor-args "USDCoin" "USDC" 6 \
    --private-key <your_private_key> \
    contracts/token/DummyERC20.sol:DummyERC20
  ```
  update the constructor arguments according to your needs.
- The app chain's token addresses will be required during running the setup script.

## Deployment

**Note:** Ensure you have the correct environment variables set in your .env file. You need to set `OWNER_SIGNER_KEY` and RPC URLs for the network you are deploying to.

To deploy the contracts, run:

```bash
yarn script:deploy
```

**Note:** based on the chain you may run into some rpc issues like `intrinsic gas too low`, etc. while running the deploy script. We store network overrides in `script/helpers/networks.ts`. You can add overrides for gasPrice, gasLimits to be used by all scripts. For example, if you are running the script for arbitrum sepolia, and it throw `intrinsic gas too low` error, try increasing gas limit for arbitrum sepolia to 5 million and retry.

## Verify the contracts on a block explorer

To verify the contracts on a block explorer, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn script:verify --network <your network>
```

If you are verifying the contracts for SuperBridge on the destination chain and the verify command throws an error `H100: Network doesn't exist`, you need to update the `hardhat.config.ts` file to add the network -

- add your network name in `CustomNetworks`
- add your network's config in `CustomNetworksConfig` (chainId, rpc, accounts)
- add your networks name in `liveNetworks` array
- add verification api key in `config.etherscan.apiKey`
- add your network's verification config in `config.etherscan.customChains` (chainId, browserUrl, verification api Url). This config is used by `hardhat-etherscan` plugin to verify contracts.

## Test Token Bridging

To test your deployment, you can use the following command to send a bridge transaction -

```bash
yarn script:bridge --srcChain 421614 --dstChain 11155420 --token USDC --amount 1
```

the `PROJECT` env variable should be set in `.env` file. It is used to fetch relevant bridge addresses.

## Project Constants Help Guide

- **Vault Chains** - The chains where the token contract is already deployed, and the token will be locked/unlocked for bridging.

  - For SuperBridge, we will have ≥1 vault chains where we will bridge from.
  - For SuperToken, if the token is already deployed on a chain, then that chain will be a vault chain. If it is a fresh SuperToken deployment (token does not exist on any chain), there will be no vault chains. Therefore, for SuperToken, the number of vault chains ≤1.

- **Controller Chains** - The chains where the token is minted/burned.

  - For SuperBridge, this will be the new chain where users are bridging. There will be only 1 controller chain (app chain) for SuperBridge.
  - For SuperToken, all the chains (except the one where the token is deployed) are controller chains, as the token is minted/burned. The number of controller chains ≥1.
  - Note: If you are not able to find your chain in the list of chains during setup, check if the chain already has socket core contracts deployed, and if you have updated the @socket.tech/dl-core package.

- **Hooks** - Hooks are plugins that can be added for extra functionality. We have 2 options for hooks right now:

  - **LIMIT_HOOK** - This hook enforces daily send and receive limits for a token. It makes sure that in case of a hack, the flow of funds is rate-limited. It also checks before withdrawal whether the destination chain has enough funds for successful bridging, and reverts on the source chain to avoid the bad UX of stuck funds. This is the recommended hook. With this hook, we need to specify sending and receiving limits for each token and each supported chain.
  - **LIMIT_EXECUTION_HOOK** - This hook extends the capability of LIMIT_HOOK and allows for arbitrary payload execution on the destination after the bridge is successful.
    You can also write your own custom hooks and plug them into the bridge contracts.

- **Rate Limits** - You can specify per token daily sending and receiving limits.

  - The limits are specified in formatted (ETH) values, i.e., use 1000 for a 1000 USDC limit. The limit specified is the max daily limit.
  - When a user bridges, the current limit is reduced and is regenerated per second (rate = max_limit / 86400 per sec) until it reaches the max limit again. If a user bridges an amount that is greater than the current limit, then the current limit amount of tokens is sent to the user, and the rest are stored as pending, which are released as the limit regenerates.
  - There are view functions on the LIMIT_HOOK contract to fetch the max limit, current limit, rate of increase, etc.
  - Rate limits help to reduce the attack surface in case of a hack by limiting the throughput of the bridge.

- **Integration Types** - We have 3 options for integration types (Recommended: FAST)
  - FAST: This is the default integration type. It uses socket's 1/n security model to verify messages. Bridging time is ~5-10 mins.
  - OPTIMISTIC: This integration type uses an optimistic security model, where messages are executed after 2 hours.
  - NATIVE_BRIDGE: This uses the native messaging bridge of underlying chains. This provides the security of NATIVE bridges.
- **Pool Count** - This only applies for SuperBridge. Normally, we don't need to specify this and have a default value of 0.
  - When we are bridging out from an App chain (controller chain), we check if the destination chain has enough liquidity to allow the user to bridge successfully. This accounting is done in poolPlugin.
  - We support different paths for bridging, i.e., FAST, OPTIMISTIC, and NATIVE_BRIDGE. If a user bridges to a chain using the NATIVE_BRIDGE path and wants to withdraw using the FAST path, we can allow the user to do that by keeping the poolCount for both paths the same. If we don't want to allow this, we can restrict this behavior by keeping the poolId different.
  - Pool count can also be used for deployments where two or more tokens on the vault chain are mapped to the same token on the App chain. Examples of this include: USDC and USDC.e mapped to a single USDC instance on the App chain, ETH and WETH mapped to a single WETH instance on the App chain.
    In such deployments, it is recommended to separate accounting for both vaults since they are responsible for different assets. We recommend changing the poolCount for one of the token vaults. The convention to follow is:
    - 0 for USDC
    - 1 for USDC.e
    - 0 for ETH
    - 1 for WETH

## Test

Tests are run using the [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) tool of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

```bash
forge test
```

## Test Token Faucets

Use these faucets to receive test tokens on Arbitrum Sepolia and Optimism Sepolia testnets. Each request will send you 1000 units of the requested tokens (adjusted for token decimals). These can be used on the demo projects deployed when adding a new chain.

### Faucet Addresses

- Arbitrum Sepolia: [0x406c77947d91f965f09b458c07a66a033c3efea4](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x406c77947d91f965f09b458c07a66a033c3efea4)
- Optimism Sepolia: [0xbebfcb5a41836490c6449ce755c8dc361c175aa3](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0xbebfcb5a41836490c6449ce755c8dc361c175aa3)

### How to Use

You can request tokens using Foundry's `cast` command. Here's an example using Arbitrum Sepolia:

```bash
cast send 0x406c77947d91f965f09b458c07a66a033c3efea4 "getTokens(address,address[])" YOUR_ADDRESS "[TOKEN_ADDRESS]" --rpc-url https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc --private-key $YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

#### Example

To get test USDC on Arbitrum Sepolia:

```bash
cast send 0x406c77947d91f965f09b458c07a66a033c3efea4 "getTokens(address,address[])" YOUR_ADDRESS "[0x8537307810fC40F4073A12a38554D4Ff78EfFf41]" --rpc-url https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc --private-key $YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Replace:

- `YOUR_ADDRESS` with your wallet address
- `$YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your private key environment variable

For Optimism Sepolia, use the Optimism faucet address and RPC URL: `https://sepolia.optimism.io`
